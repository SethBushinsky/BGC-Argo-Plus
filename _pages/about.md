The BGC-Argo-Plus dataset is a product of the HI-Cycles group at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, led by Seth Bushinsky. Our group began work on this product in October of 2023 to develop a float data product that represented our combined group efforts to make the data as "good" and useable as possible. This effort included several main components:
- Correct deep oxygen bias first noted in [Bushinsky et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10107) and [Drucker and Riser (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mio.2016.09.007). Subsequently seen in [Gouretski et al. (2024)](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/16/5503/2024/) and [Bushinsky et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GB008185). The approach for finding and correcting this bias is described in [Bushinsky et al. (2025)] and Nachod et al. (in prep.)
- Find and remove outliers from the oxygen, nitrate, pH, temperature, or salinity data that was currently in the "ADJUSTED" float data
    - details about specific types of outliers removed and the approach followed can be found in Bushinsky et al. (in prep) (and elsewhere in this website?)
- Calculate common derived or ancillary parameters that our group commonly uses in our analysis and that others will likely make use of as well

As part of this effort we are informing individual float PIs and data centers of the issues that we find (or think we've found). Eventually we hope that this sort of secondary QC effort is no longer necessary. For now we believe it is important to keep looking into the data in as much detail as possible to improve its utility for all users. It is one thing to deploy new floats, but improving existing data adds measurements we can never make again. Both are necessary to move this area of oceanography forward.
