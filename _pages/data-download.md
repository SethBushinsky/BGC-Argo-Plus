## Float file details

### Variables originally included in the Sprof files that are modified:
Variable name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
[VAR] | Unchanged | Raw variable copied directly from DAC
[VAR]_ADJUSTED | Unchanged | ADJUSTED variable copied directly from DAC
[VAR]_BGCArgoPlus | Biogeochemical Argo+ version | Variable modified from DAC according to the processing level description
[VAR]_BGCArgoPlus_ProcessingLevel | Biogeochemical Argo+ version | Processing level of variable

**Processing Level Descriptors:** \
"RTA/DM" - Mode allowed (RTA = Real Time Adjusted and delayed mode allowed, DM = only delayed mode allowed)\
"F" - DAC QC flags applied (Bad data flagged as NaN)\
"RO" - Outlier removed\
"O2Bias" - O2 Bias correction applied (Bushinsky et al., 2025, Nachod et al., in prep)\
"Thermo" - Thermodynamic correction applied to pK1/pK2 (Johnson et al., in prep)

### Newly calculated derived variables added to the BGCArgoPlus files:
Variable name | Description
--- | --- 
TALK_BGCArgoPlus | Alkalinity estimated from ESPER Mixed, which is an average of ESPER neural network and ESPER multiple linear regression (Carter et al. 2023)
DIC_BGCArgoPlus | DIC calculated from float pH and TALK_BGCArgoPlus. O2 Bias Correction applied where possible and the Johnson et al. XXXX adjustment to pk1 and pk2 used. 
sigma0 | Potential Density calculated using gsw.SA_from_SP, gsw.CT_from_t, gsw.sigma0
cons_temp | Conservative temperature calculated using gsw.CT_from_t
spiciness0 | Spiciness calculated using using gsw.SA_from_SP, gsw.CT_from_t, gsw.spiciness0
gamma | Neutral density calculated using Matlab eos80_legacy_gamma_n from **XXXX**
depth | Depth calculated using gsw.conversions.z_from_p
MLD | MLD calculated using De Boyer Montegue et al. 2004 (modified to work w/ under ice data as well)
DOXY_SAT | The saturation concentration of oxygen using Garcia and Gordon 1992 (gsw.O2sol_SP_pt). Assumes standard atmospheric pressure.
